### [Ascoviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/dsdna-viruses/w/ascoviridae)

**Morphology**  Virions of ascoviruses are either bacilliform, ovoidal or allantoid in shape, and depending on the species, have complex symmetry, and are large, measuring approximately 130 nm in diameter by 200-400 nm in length. The virion consists of an inner particle surrounded by an outer envelope. 

![Ascoviridae Image - Morphology of ascovirus virions. A. Schematic illustration of the structure of a typical ascovirus virion. The virion consists of an inner particle and an outer envelope. The inner particle is complex and contains a DNA/protein core surrounded by an apparent unit membrane, the external surface of which bears a layer of distinctive protein subunits. B, C. Respectively, ultrathin longitudinal- and cross-sections through typical ascovirus virions (SfAV-1a). The dense inner layer corresponds with the distinctive layer of subunits shown in A. D to F. Negatively stained preparations of virions from three different ascovirus species: D, Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus 1a (SfAV-1a); E, Trichoplusia ni ascovirus 2a (TnAV-2a), and F, Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3a (HvAV-3a). The reticulate appearance of the virions is thought to be due to the superimposition of top and bottom layers of the inner particle and the outer envelope. Bar = 50 nm.](https://talk.ictvonline.org/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-59/ODD.Asc.Fig1.v1.png)

### [Asfarviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/dsdna-viruses/w/asfarviridae)

**Morphology** African swine fever virus (ASFV) virions consist of a nucleoprotein core structure, 70–100 nm in diameter, surrounded by an internal lipid layer and an icosahedral capsid, 170–190 nm in diameter, which in turn is eventually surrounded by an external lipid-containing envelope.

### [Iridoviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/dsdna-viruses/w/iridoviridae)

**Morphology** Virions consist, of a central DNA/protein core surrounded in turn by an internal limiting membrane, a viral capsid, and, in the case of those particles that bud from the plasma membrane, an outer viral envelope. Viral capsids display icosahedral symmetry (Figure 2A.Iridoviridae) and are usually 120–200 nm in diameter, but may be up to 350 nm (e.g. genus Lymphocystivirus).

### [Ampullaviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/dsdna-viruses/w/ampullaviridae)

***Morphology***  The virion of Acidianus bottle shaped virus (ABV) is enveloped, resembles in its shape a bottle and has an overall length of about 230 nm and a width varying from about 75 nm, at the broad end, to 4 nm, at the pointed end (Figure 1.Ampullaviridae). The broad end of the virion exhibits 20 (±2) thin rigid filaments (20 nm long and 3 nm in width), which appear to be interconnected at their bases and regularly distributed around, and inserted into, a disc or ring. The 9 nm thick envelope encases a cone-shaped core formed by a torroidally supercoiled nucleoprotein filament, 7 nm in width. The bottle-shaped morphology is unprecedented among viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes  and represents a group of archaea-specific virion morphotypes

###  [Baculoviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/dsdna-viruses/w/baculoviridae)

***Morphology***  One or two virion phenotypes are involved in baculovirus infections. Infection is initiated in the gut epithelium by virions contained within a crystalline protein occlusion body (OB) which may be polyhedral in shape and containing many virions (members of the genera Alphabaculovirus, Gammabaculovirus and Deltabaculovirus); or ovocylindrical and containing only one, or rarely two or more, virions (members of the genus Betabaculovirus). Virions within occlusions, referred to as occlusion-derived virus (ODV), consist of one or more rod-shaped nucleocapsids that have a distinct structural polarity and are enclosed within an envelope (Figure 1.Baculoviridae). For ODV, nucleocapsid envelopment occurs within the nucleus (members of the genus Alphabaculovirus) or in the nuclear-cytoplasmic milieu after loss of the nuclear membrane (members of the genus Betabaculovirus). Nucleocapsids average 30–60 nm in diameter and 250–300 nm in length.

### [Phycodnaviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/dsdna-viruses-2011/w/dsdna_viruses/123/phycodnaviridae)

***Morphology*** Originally, all phycodnavirus virions were assumed to be large icosahedral structures (120–220 nm in diameter) with a multilaminate shell surrounding an electron dense core and lacking an external membrane. However, recent experiments indicate that not all virus structures are identical.

(B) Putative tail structure (arrowed) can be observed in Emiliania huxleyi virus EhV-86 in the cytoplasm of infected Emiliania huxleyi before release of progeny virions (approx. 3 h p.i.) (adapted from Mackinder et al. (2010). J. Gen. Virol., 90, 2306-2316; with permission). (C) PBCV-1 attached to the cell wall of its host as viewed by the quick-freeze, deep-etch procedure. Note: fibers attach the virus to the wall (photo courtesy of John Heuser).

***Morphology*** Virions have a complex construction, consisting of a nucleocapsid and a single or double layer envelope. Virions consist of one or more enveloped nucleocapsids. Polydnaviruses are divided into two genera, Bracovirus and Ichnovirus, which share few morphological features

### [Polyomaviridae](https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/dsdna-viruses-2011/w/dsdna_viruses/129/polyomaviridae)

***Morphology*** Virions are non-enveloped and approximately 40–45 nm in diameter.
